The tumor lightsheet image analysis code is organized into 5 modules that include data **pre-processing**, **segmentation**, **segmentation post-processing**, **distance transformation**, and **penetration profile generation**. (See the pipeline overview [HERE](methodology_overview.md))

** This code can be operated as either**: 

* An automated pipeline: which can analyze a dataset with minimal user input, or 

* A manual pipeline: which allows each module in the pipeline to be run separately, allowing further user defined customization.  


See the sections on code modules [HERE](Modules/segmentation.md) and code usage for more details [HERE.](code usuage.md)
